# Guillotine

## Attacking

### From standing

- Wrap hand around uke's neck (under your armpit)
- Close hand and form a punch
- Hard part of wrist should be pressed to adams apple
- The other hand should hold the "punch"
- Without moving shoulder just close the elbow angle (raise wrist, keep eblow and shoulder steady
- Use the other hand to pull the "punch" so that it presses opponents neck.

### From standing to ground
- Start as above, but instead of pulling the "punch"...
- Lower the whole body until you sit in the ground.
- Hold opponent in closed guard
