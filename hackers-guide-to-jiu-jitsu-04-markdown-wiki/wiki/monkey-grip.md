# Monkey Grip

### From the Internet
The Gable Grip (aka Monkey Grip) is nicknamed after the legendary American freestyle wrestler Dan Gable – 1972 Olympic champion and 1971 World champion.

An excellent weapon for the clinching game, the Gable allows you to control the distance and apply pressure, being often referred to as a ‘Greco Grip’ due to that characteristic. The gable is also highly applicable in a submission environment to finish straight armlocks such as the ‘violin’ or chokes like the arm triangle (katagatame), the Monson (north-south) or the Japanese necktie, to name a few.

The Gable grip is also referred to as Gable Lock and as Monkey Grip.
