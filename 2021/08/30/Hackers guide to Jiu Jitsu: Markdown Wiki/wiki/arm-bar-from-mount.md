# Arm bar from mount

This is the [Arm bar](./arm-bar.md) variation from [mount](./mount.md).

- Move as high as possible
- Pass one hand around the straight arm and towards opponents chest.
- Swivel around the straight arm, so that both legs "hug" the arm.
- Once aligned with hand, fallback
- Raise your heap until opponent taps out.
